<p>Are you looking for a one-liner for some purpose and it's not on the site yet? (Surely you searched well, right?)
Feel free to ask for it here.</p>

<ul>
    <li>After you post a question, it will be listed on this page, and other users can post one-liners (possibly many) that answer your question, until you mark your question <strong>Answered</strong>, after which people cannot post answers anymore.</li>
    <li>A question can be <strong>Published</strong>, or not, in which case it will not be visible on this page and you can edit and publish later.</li>
    <li>Soon we will implement email notifications when somebody posts an answer to your question. Until then, you can track your questions and answers on your <a href="{% url bashoneliners.main.views.profile %}">profile</a> page or by following the <a href="{% url bashoneliners.urls.feed %}">RSS</a> feed or <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/bashoneliners">@bashoneliners</a> on Twitter.</li>
</ul>
