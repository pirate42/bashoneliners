release notes
=============
- Explanation and Limitations are now shown expanded by default
- If you are interested to test but prefer to not be too public, you can use http://dev.bashoneliners.com/. Just keep in mind that it is a test site, and I might break it or reset it from time to time, so your data won't be safe there.
- I am not sure if all of you are interested in these announcements and updates, so in the future I will use the mailing list. You can subscribe to it here: 
- Adjusted formatting, margins
